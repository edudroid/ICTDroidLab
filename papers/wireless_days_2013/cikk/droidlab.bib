@article{Demirbas2010,
abstract = {Despite the availability of the sensor and smart-phone devices to fulfill the ubiquitous computing vision, the-state-of-the-art falls short of this vision. We argue that the reason for this gap is the lack of an infrastructure to task/utilize these devices for collaboration. We propose that microblogging services like Twitter can provide an open publish-subscribe infrastructure for sensors and smartphones, and pave the way for ubiquitous crowd-sourced sensing and collaboration applications. We design and implement a crowd-sourced sensing and collaboration system over Twitter, and showcase our system in the context of two applications: a crowd-sourced weather radar, and a participatory noise-mapping application. Our results from real-world Twitter experiments give insights into the feasibility of this approach and outline the research challenges in sensor/smartphone integration to Twitter.},

@article{Reddy2010,
abstract = {Mobile phones have evolved from devices that are just used for voice and text communication to platforms that are able to capture and transmit a range of data types (image, audio, and location). The adoption of these increasingly capable devices by society has enabled a potentially pervasive sensing paradigm - participatory sensing. A coordinated participatory sensing system engages individuals carrying mobile phones to explore phenomena of interest using in situ data collection. For participatory sensing to succeed, several technical challenges need to be solved. In this paper, we discuss one particular issue: developing a recruitment framework to enable organizers to identify well-suited participants for data collections based on geographic and temporal availability as well as participation habits. This recruitment system is evaluated through a series of pilot data collections where volunteers explored sustainable pro- cesses on a university campus.},
