Version 5.0.1 - November 01 2010
- fixed last ereg-deprecatements
- rename block command ( BEGIN - END  into LOOP - ENDLOOP)

Version 5.0 - January 01 2009
- First version designed specifically for PHP5
- Changed default for 'reuse_code' to false
- Added LPGL script dp.SyntaxHighlighter 
- Added Extension 'codesnippetstart'
- Added Extension 'codesnippetend'
- changed behavior of all extensions - they no longer set the $_CONFIG array variales
- added new default template
- added code for Syntax Highlighter

using Syntax Highlighter:
In your HTML code, add:
{codesnippetstart:}
... your php code
{codesnippetend:}
Everything else is done for you.
Please note that if you want to include the PHP start tag (ie. <?php ) and the PHP end tag (ie. ?> )
in the code snippeg, you must use them like this:
&lt;?php
and
?&gt;
... the reason for this is that using the PHP start tag and end tag would process the code as a
php script prior to the code snippet display and would mess up the page.
