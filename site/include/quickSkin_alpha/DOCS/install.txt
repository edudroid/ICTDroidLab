To install and use QuickSkin:

1. Uncompress the ZIP file to your local computer

-- FULL INSTALLATION

   Copy the files to your webserver. We recommend that you put those in a 
   directory structure that resembles:
   
   /_lib/class.quickskin.php
   /_lib/class.quickskindebugger.php
   /_lib/qx/{all files that start with qx_}
   
-- MINIMAL INSTALLATION
   
   If you want to install the absolutely bare-bones installation, copy only
   the base class file to your webserver. We recommend that you put that file in
   the following directory structure:
   
   /_lib/class.quickskin.php
   
2. Create a directory for your compiled/cached files. We recommend:

   /_skins_tmp/
   
3. If you are using QuickSkin as part of a framework or plan to reuse your
   code often, we recommend that you create a template structure such as:
   
   /_skins/
   /_skins/default/         (to store your template HTML files)
   /_skins/default/tplimgs/ (to store your template images and CSS files)
   /_skins/default/tpljs/   (to store your template Javascript files)
   /_skins_tmp/             (to store all compiled and cached files)
   
   With this kind of structure, you are able to create/edit your HTML 
   files with any HTML editor (MS FrontPage, MS Expression Web, Macromedia
   Dreamweaver, etc.). All of your references to locations of Javascript
   files, images, and CSS files will reference the directory under the
   HTML template file (ie. <img src="tplimgs/yourimage.jpg>). This 
   is simple and convenient for both you and your users. Continue reading
   for examples on how to take advantage of this directory structure.
   
4. All you need to use QuickSkin, is to instantiate it inside of your
   script. If you used the directory structure we recommended, that looks like:
   
   include_once('/_lib/class.quickskin.php');
   
   $page = new QuickSkin( "default/yourtemplate.htm" );
   
   $page->assign( 'title',  'TemplateDemo' );
   $page->assign( 'welcome', 'My Welcome' );
   
   $page->assign('welcome', 'My Welcome');
   
   $page->set('template_dir', '_skins/');
   $page->set('temp_dir', '_skins_tmp/');
   $page->set('cache_dir', '_skins_tmp/');
   
   // do substitute of template image directory
   $page->assign('tpl_img', 'tplimgs/');
   $page->assign('url_img', 'http://www.yourdomain.com/_skins/default/tplimgs/');
   
   // do substitute of template javascript directory
   $page->assign('tpl_js', 'tpljs/');
   $page->assign('url_js', 'http://www.yourdomain.com/_skins/default/tpljs/');
   
   $page->addtpl('sponsors', '_skins/default/sponsors.htm');
   
   //$page->debug();

   $page->output();
   
Experiment. It is pretty simple to work the system and the scripts are
well documented.

If you are a previous user of SmartTemplate, the new version is completely code
compatible with version 1.2.1 - with ONE EXCEPTION. The default for 'reuse_code'
is now FALSE. There's quite a few enhancements that you will want to explore.

Andy Prevost.
