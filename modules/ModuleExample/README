Modules are uploaded to the device in one of two ways. Either from the back-end, or
in case of local development through Android assets.

To include your test module in the ICTDroidLab core, you have to first rename
vars.bat.template to vars.bat set the module's name and specify the core 
project's root folder. You'll find detailed instructions in the template.

Than you have to rename module.desc.template to module.desc and fill in the
proper values. Build using ant and voilá, you have your module up and running.
